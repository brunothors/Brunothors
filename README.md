## Hi there 👋

#### My name is Bruno Thorstensen

---

I'm currently an aspiring software developer studying at 42 school.
I love challenges and learning things by myself as well as being taught by my peers.
My intent is to become a great professional someday, and work on problems that will make a difference on people's everyday life.
On this github you will find some of the projects I made in 42, hope you find something interesting.
